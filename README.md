CloudSim â€“ A C++ CLI Cloud Storage App 
CloudSim is a cloud-based file storage system written in C++. It allows users to securely store and manage files with authentication and logging features.

Originally, it was inspired by a Python spyware project I was experimenting with, but it evolved into a cloud storage solution.
